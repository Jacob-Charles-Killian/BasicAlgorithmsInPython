# BasicAlgorithmsInPython
A repository of basic algorithms in python

I will be implementing all of the algorithms in this list on Medium using Python.  I also have a "Mastering Algorithms with Perl" O'Reilly book which I'll be drawing from for additional algorithms.  Translating Perl short-cuts to Python will be an interesting exercise.

Additional algorithms will be added to the list.

I hadn't practiced these data structures and algorithms with intention since high-school programming in Turbo Pascal.  Even studying ansi-standard C, perl, and C++ at Northern Virginia Community College did not get to implementing algorithms.  I was really lucky to have learned them in high school.  This feels like getting on a bicycle for the first time in twenty years.

I'm currently working on building a linked-list class with push/pull/insert/delete/search/print methods.  I'm also going to build an extensible data validity checker into the linked-list.  Once I have the linked-list class complete, I'll be building the binary-tree class next.  Each class will be thouroughly documented in a way that someone reading the code can learn about the theory behind it.
